# Cheesy-Pursuit
A remake of a Windows 95 game that I loved playing back in the day. Had a lot of fun making this.

Uses simple "depth first" search to generate the maze. read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

Key features
- Written in JavaScript
- unique maze generation
- if two players enter the same cell, both teleport to random parts of the maze
- if one player reaches the cheese, game ends
